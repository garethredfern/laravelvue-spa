If you are wanting to go down the route of having a completely separate SPA that consumes a Laravel API then these docs should provide all the reference you need to get things set up.

If you would like to hear an excellent explanation from Taylor on the how Sanctum and Fortify came about I highly recommend listening to his [podcast episode](https://blog.laravel.com/laravel-snippet-25-ecosystem-discussion-auth-recap-passport-sanctum).

The example project files can be found on GitHub:

- [Larvel API](https://github.com/garethredfern/laravel-api)
- [Vue SPA](https://github.com/garethredfern/laravel-vue)

### Questions

If you have any questions please feel free to [start a discussion](https://github.com/garethredfern/laravelvue-spa/discussions) over on GitHub.

### Further Learning
[Codecourse](https://codecourse.com/) provides some excellent video tutorials on the subjects covered on this site and I highly recommend you take a look at the following:

- [Laravel Sanctum Authentication with the Vue Composition API](https://codecourse.com/courses/laravel-sanctum-authentication-with-the-vue-composition-api)
- [Vue Middleware Pipelines](https://codecourse.com/courses/create-vue-middleware-pipelines)
- [Laravel Sanctum (Airlock) with Vue](https://codecourse.com/courses/laravel-airlock-with-vue)
- [Laravel Sanctum (Airlock) with Postman](https://codecourse.com/courses/laravel-sanctum-airlock-with-postman)

### Help to Grow

I want to keep growing this resource and provide a full set of documentation/videos on how to build Vue & Nuxt SPA's with a Laravel API. The plan is to release weekly updates until all areas of building an API and SPA are covered.
