If you are wanting to go down the route of having a completely separate SPA that consumes a Laravel API then these docs should provide all the reference you need to get things set up.

If you would like to hear an excellent explanation from Taylor on the how Sanctum and Fortify came about I highly recommend listening to his [podcast episode](https://blog.laravel.com/laravel-snippet-25-ecosystem-discussion-auth-recap-passport-sanctum).

The example project files can be found on Github:

- [Larvel API](https://github.com/garethredfern/laravel-api)
- [Vue SPA](https://github.com/garethredfern/laravel-vue)
