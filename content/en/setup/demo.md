To see what you will be building, you will need to install the Laravel API and the Vue Spa locally.

The instructions to set the local projects up can be found here:

- [laravel-setup](/setup/laravel-setup)
- [vue-setup](/setup/vue-setup)

Once you have everything installed locally you can create an account and login to see the demo.
